# Visual Physiology Opsin Database (VPOD)
_VPOD_, a database opsin data and machine-learning models to predict phenotype.
**Summary**
Here, we report a newly compiled database of all heterologously expressed opsin genes with λmax phenotypes called the Visual Physiology Opsin Database (VPOD). VPOD_1.0 contains 864 unique opsin genotypes and corresponding λmax phenotypes collected across all animals from 73 separate publications. 

We use VPOD data and [deepBreaks](https://github.com/omicsEye/deepbreaks)(an ML tool designed for exploring genotype-phenotype associations) to show regression-based machine learning (ML) models often reliably predict λmax, account for non-additive effects of mutations on function, and identify functionally critical amino acid sites.
