DATASET_SYMBOL
#Symbol datasets allow the display of various symbols on the branches of the tree. For each node, one or more symbols can be defined.
#Each symbol's color, size and position along the branch can be specified.

#lines starting with a hash are comments and ignored during parsing

#                    MANDATORY SETTINGS                           #
#=================================================================#
#select the separator which is used to delimit the data below (TAB,SPACE or COMMA).This separator must be used throughout this file.
#SEPARATOR TAB
#SEPARATOR SPACE
SEPARATOR COMMA

#label is used in the legend table (can be changed later)
DATASET_LABEL,example symbols

#dataset color (can be changed later)

#Each dataset can have a legend, which is defined using LEGEND_XXX fields below
#For each row in the legend, there should be one shape, color and label.
#Optionally, you can define an exact legend position using LEGEND_POSITION_X and LEGEND_POSITION_Y. To use automatic legend positioning, do NOT define these values
#Optionally, shape scaling can be present (LEGEND_SHAPE_SCALES). For each shape, you can define a scaling factor between 0 and 1.
#Optionally, shapes can be inverted (LEGEND_SHAPE_INVERT). When inverted, shape border will be drawn using the selected color, and the fill color will be white.
#To order legend entries horizontally instead of vertically, set LEGEND_HORIZONTAL to 1
#Shape should be a number between 1 and 6, or any protein domain shape definition.
#1: square
#2: circle
#3: star
#4: right pointing triangle
#5: left pointing triangle
#6: checkmark

#largest symbol will be displayed with this size, others will be proportionally smaller.
MAXIMUM_SIZE,50

#symbols can be filled with solid color, or a gradient
#GRADIENT_FILL,1

#Internal tree nodes can be specified using IDs directly, or using the 'last common ancestor' method described in iTOL help pages
#=================================================================#
#       Actual data follows after the "DATA" keyword              #
#=================================================================#
#the following fields are required for each node:
#ID,symbol,size,color,fill,position,label
#symbol should be a number between 1 and 5:
#1: rectangle
#2: circle
#3: star
#4: right pointing triangle
#5: left pointing triangle
#6: checkmark

#size can be any number. Maximum size in the dataset will be displayed using MAXIMUM_SIZE, while others will be proportionally smaller
#color can be in hexadecimal, RGB or RGBA notation. If RGB or RGBA are used, dataset SEPARATOR cannot be comma.
#fill can be 1 or 0. If set to 0, only the outline of the symbol will be displayed.
#position is a number between 0 and 1 and defines the position of the symbol on the branch (for example, position 0 is exactly at the start of node branch, position 0.5 is in the middle, and position 1 is at the end)

DATA
#Examples

#internal node will have a red filled circle in the middle of the branch
#9606|184922,2,10,#ff0000,1,0.5

#node 100379 will have a blue star outline at the start of the branch, half the size of the circle defined above (size is 5 compared to 10 above)
#100379,3,5,#0000ff,0,0
#node 100379 will also have a filled green rectangle in the middle of the branch, same size as the circle defined above (size is 10)
#100379,1,10,#00ff00,1,0.5
