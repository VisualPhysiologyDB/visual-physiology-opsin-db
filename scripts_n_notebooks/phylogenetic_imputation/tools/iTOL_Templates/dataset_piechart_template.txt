DATASET_PIECHART
#In pie chart datasets, each ID is associated to multiple numeric values, which are displayed as a pie chart directly on the node branch, or outside the tree
#lines starting with a hash are comments and ignored during parsing

#label is used in the legend table (can be changed later)

#Each dataset can have a legend, which is defined using LEGEND_XXX fields below
#For each row in the legend, there should be one shape, color and label.
#Optionally, you can define an exact legend position using LEGEND_POSITION_X and LEGEND_POSITION_Y. To use automatic legend positioning, do NOT define these values
#Optionally, shape scaling can be present (LEGEND_SHAPE_SCALES). For each shape, you can define a scaling factor between 0 and 1.
#To order legend entries horizontally instead of vertically, set LEGEND_HORIZONTAL to 1
#Shape should be a number between 1 and 6, or any protein domain shape definition.
#1: square
#2: circle
#3: star
#4: right pointing triangle
#5: left pointing triangle
#6: checkmark

#left margin, used to increase/decrease the spacing to the next dataset. Can be negative, causing datasets to overlap. Used only for piecharts which are displayed on the outside
#MARGIN,0

#applies to external pie charts only; if set, pie charts associated to internal nodes will be displayed even if these nodes are not collapsed. It could cause overlapping in the dataset display.
#SHOW_INTERNAL,0

#maximum pie chart radius will be displayed with this size, others will be proportionally smaller. This setting applies to internal pie charts only.
#MAXIMUM_SIZE,50

#pie chart height factor; For external pie charts, default radius will be slightly less than the available space between leaves, but you can set a multiplication factor here to increase/decrease it (values from 0 to 1 will decrease it, values above 1 will increase it)
#HEIGHT_FACTOR,1

#border width; if set above 0, a border of specified width (in pixels) will be drawn around the pie chart segments 
#BORDER_WIDTH,0

#border color; used when BORDER_WIDTH is above 0
#BORDER_COLOR,#0000ff

#display data as polar area diagrams (equal arcs with varying radius), instead of standard pie charts (varying arcs of equal radius)
#POLAR_AREA_DIAGRAM,0

#Internal tree nodes can be specified using IDs directly, or using the 'last common ancestor' method described in iTOL help pages
#=================================================================#
#       Actual data follows after the "DATA" keyword              #
#=================================================================#
#the following fields are required for each node:
#ID,position,radius,value1,value2,value3...
#position defines the position of the pie chart on the tree:
#  -1 = external pie chart
#  a number between 0 and 1 = internal pie chart positioned at the specified value along the node branch (for example, position 0 is exactly at the start of node branch, position 0.5 is in the middle, and position 1 is at the end)

DATA
#Examples

#node 9606 will have an external pie chart
#9606,-1,10,10000,15000,9000

#node 9123 will have an internal pie chart directly over the node, and with radius 50 (actual display radius will depend on other values in the dataset and the MAXIMUM_SIZE specified)
#9132,0,50,11000,9000,120007
