DATASET_BINARY
#Binary datasets are visualized as filled or empty symbols, depending on the value associated with a node (0 or 1).
#Each node can have multiple associated values, and each value will be represented by a symbol (defined in FIELD_SHAPES) with corresponding color and label (from FIELD_COLORS and FIELD_LABELS).
#Possible values (defined under DATA below) for each node are 1 (filled shapes), 0 (empty shapes) and -1 (completely omitted).

#lines starting with a hash are comments and ignored during parsing

#Each dataset can have a legend, which is defined using LEGEND_XXX fields below
#For each row in the legend, there should be one shape, color and label.
#Optionally, you can define an exact legend position using LEGEND_POSITION_X and LEGEND_POSITION_Y. To use automatic legend positioning, do NOT define these values
#Optionally, shape scaling can be present (LEGEND_SHAPE_SCALES). For each shape, you can define a scaling factor between 0 and 1.
#To order legend entries horizontally instead of vertically, set LEGEND_HORIZONTAL to 1
#Shape should be a number between 1 and 6, or any protein domain shape definition.
#1: square
#2: circle
#3: star
#4: right pointing triangle
#5: left pointing triangle
#6: checkmark
