DATASET_BOXPLOT
#Box plots (box and whisker diagrams) display the distribution of data based on the five number summary: minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum.
#In addition to a box plot, each node can have an unlimited number of extremes defined

#lines starting with a hash are comments and ignored during parsing

#DATASET_SCALE,2000,10000,20000

#Each dataset can have a legend, which is defined using LEGEND_XXX fields below
#For each row in the legend, there should be one shape, color and label.
#Optionally, you can define an exact legend position using LEGEND_POSITION_X and LEGEND_POSITION_Y. To use automatic legend positioning, do NOT define these values
#Optionally, shape scaling can be present (LEGEND_SHAPE_SCALES). For each shape, you can define a scaling factor between 0 and 1.
#To order legend entries horizontally instead of vertically, set LEGEND_HORIZONTAL to 1
#Shape should be a number between 1 and 6, or any protein domain shape definition.
#1: square
#2: circle
#3: star
#4: right pointing triangle
#5: left pointing triangle
#6: checkmark

#left margin, used to increase/decrease the spacing to the next dataset. Can be negative, causing datasets to overlap.
#MARGIN,0

#always show internal values; if set, values associated to internal nodes will be displayed even if these nodes are not collapsed. It could cause overlapping in the dataset display.
#SHOW_INTERNAL,0

#show dashed lines between leaf labels and the dataset
#DASHED_LINES,1

#bar height factor; Default bar height will be slightly less than the available space between leaves, but you can set a multiplication factor here to increase/decrease it (values from 0 to 1 will decrease it, values above 1 will increase it)
#HEIGHT_FACTOR,1

#Bars are aligned to the node lines by default. Using BAR_SHIFT, you can move them all up/down by a fixed amount
#BAR_SHIFT,0


#Internal tree nodes can be specified using IDs directly, or using the 'last common ancestor' method described in iTOL help pages
